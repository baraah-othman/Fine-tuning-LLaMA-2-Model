# Fine-tuning-LLaMA-2-Model
This repository contains a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning the LLaMA-2-7b model using the Barbie-llama2-1k dataset. The fine-tuning process involves several key steps to ensure an effective and efficient model training. Below is a summary of the steps included in the provided code:

Install Required Packages: Ensure all necessary packages are installed for model training and fine-tuning.

Import Libraries: Import essential libraries such as torch, transformers, datasets, and peft.

Load and Configure Model: Load the llama-2-7b-chat-hf model and the dataset.
Set up the fine-tuning configurations including QLoRA parameters, 4-bit precision settings, and training arguments.

Fine-tune the Model: Utilize the SFTTrainer to fine-tune the LLaMA-2-7b model on the specified dataset. The training process is optimized using gradient checkpointing, gradient clipping, and cosine learning rate scheduling.

Save and Test the Model: Save the fine-tuned model and test it using a text generation pipeline. Format inputs to match the LLaMA-2 prompt template for accurate responses.

Merge Weights and Save Final Model: Reload the base model in FP16 precision, merge it with LoRA weights, and save the final model.

Push to Hugging Face Hub: Log in to the Hugging Face Hub and push the fine-tuned model along with its tokenizer to the repository for easy access and deployment.
